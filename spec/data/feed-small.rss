			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last fall, my dad spent a few days with me while he was in town (then Mankato, MN) for meetings. We ended up having some really interesting conversations one evenings. I&#8217;d like to share some of that discussion, only a few months late.</p>
<p>A little background: my dad is non-techie. He is pretty limited to reading and writing emails, and even that was a stretch at first. So that makes his observation a little more interesting, at least to me.</p>
<p>But on that evening, we somehow got on a few technical topics. After awhile, my dad made an interesting observation, comparing the internet to the human brain.</p>
<p>A little more background, a few years my dad had brain surgery to remove a tumor. So that explains some of his interest in the brain.</p>
<p>Anyways, we went on to other topics, including finding his former college roommate on LinkedIn. But I returned to his comment about the brain and the internet as I trying to fall asleep that night. And I realized he had a good point. The internet shares behavior with the human brain.</p>
<p>When a route on the internet gets really slow or fails all together, traffic will adjust its flow to use faster paths to their destination. This could be called self-healing.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, the brain also self-heals. If a pathway is blocked because a neuron has died, then the other neurons will try to find another pathway. Or in the extreme case of brain surgery, entire sections of the brain will re-wire themselves.</p>
<p>While technological advances are amazing, it&#8217;s more amazing to think about similar processes that have always been a part of us.</p>
